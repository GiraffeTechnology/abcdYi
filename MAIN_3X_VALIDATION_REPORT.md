## 2. B-side Independent Deployment

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| B-side scripts (`run_bm_e2e_mvp.py`) | PASS | All B-side steps in E2E confirmed |
| B-side API smoke (`/api/b-side/workspaces`) | PASS | Endpoint present, returns 422 on missing field (correct validation, not 500) |
| Requirement structuring | PASS | `raw_requirement` field accepted, workspace created |
| Inquiry drafting | PASS | Supplier inquiries dispatched in E2E flow |
| Feasibility / path model | PASS | Delivery path ranking verified, lead time model demo PASS |

---

## 3. M-side Independent Deployment

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Role switching (`run_role_switching_mvp.py`) | PASS | 79/79 checks |
| Send/receive role switching (`run_mside_send_receive_role_switch_test.py`) | PASS | 64 passed, 0 failed |
| Merchandiser module (`run_merchandiser_e2e_mvp.py`) | PASS | 47 passed, 0 failed |
| Logistics module (`run_logistics_cainiao_like_api_mvp.py`) | PASS | 54 passed, 0 failed |
| Standalone M-side module smoke | PASS | `create_execution_plan`, `get_tasks_for_project`, `get_milestones_for_project` all verified |

---

## 4. B/M E2E

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| BM E2E MVP (`run_bm_e2e_mvp.py`) | PASS | Full B→M→order lifecycle |
| Integrated post-confirmation (`run_integrated_post_confirmation_mvp.py`) | PASS | 56 passed, 0 failed |
| Lead time model (`run_lead_time_model_demo.py`) | PASS | 3-path demo, all verified totals |
| verify_integration (`--db sqlite:///./test.db --runs 5`) | PASS | 5/5 PASS, PRAGMA integrity ok |

---

## 5. QC + Qwen

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Qwen default provider (`DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER`) | PASS | `"qwen"` confirmed in `src/llm/provider_config.py:15` |
| Qwen default QC provider (`DEFAULT_QC_PROVIDER`) | PASS | `"qwen"` confirmed in `src/llm/provider_config.py:16` |
| Real Qwen call | SKIPPED | No `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` / `QWEN_API_KEY` in environment |
| Mock fallback | PASS | Provider registry returns `MockLLMProvider` when no key; `fallback_used=True` in reports |
| Image comparison through Qwen interface | PASS | `requested_provider=qwen`, `provider_name=mock` (fallback); `m_side_feedback_zh` present |
| Video-frame comparison through Qwen interface | PASS | `frames_used=2`, Chinese feedback in video report |
| Process-card comparison | PASS | `/api/qc/{project_id}/process-card` returns `PC-*` ID, fields correctly stored |
| M-side feedback generated | PASS | `m_side_feedback_zh` and `m_side_feedback_en` in all comparison reports |
| QC API endpoints | PASS | `/api/qc/health`, `/reference-images`, `/process-card`, `/compare`, all 200 |

**Note on Qwen interface:** `requested_provider=qwen` in all reports; mock executes because no key present. Interface routing is verified correct.

## 6. OpenClaw + WeChat

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `/api/skill/invoke` exists | PASS | `api/main.py:48` — endpoint present, handles OpenClaw normalized events |
| OpenClaw adapter exists | PASS | `src/openclaw_skill/openclaw_event_adapter.py` — `adapt_openclaw_event` function present |
| WeChat channel accepted | PASS | `channel: "wechat"` accepted and routed by adapter |
| Buyer WeChat event simulation | PASS | `ok=True`, project created `RFQ-*`, `reply_text` in Chinese, `missing_fields` surfaced |
| Supplier WeChat event simulation | PASS | `ok=True`, `status=clarification_needed` (correct: no bound project_id) |
| QC media attachment event simulation | PASS | `ok=True`, attachment received, `status=clarification_needed` |
| Real WeChat bridge | SKIPPED | No live OpenClaw WeChat bridge credentials in environment |
| Direct WeChat credentials inside Giraffe | NONE | Grep confirms no `WECHAT_APP_ID/SECRET/TOKEN`; WeChat handled entirely by OpenClaw externally |

**Architecture confirmed:** WeChat/Weixin → OpenClaw → normalized event → `/api/skill/invoke` → `adapt_openclaw_event` → Giraffe B/M flow. Giraffe never holds WeChat credentials.

## 7. DB

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| DB-off (`GIRAFFE_DB_MODE=off`) | PASS | `[run_bm_e2e_with_db] PASS` with in-memory store |
| DB-on (`GIRAFFE_DB_MODE=on`, SQLite) | PASS | `[run_bm_e2e_with_db] PASS` with real SQLite |
| QC tables created (`build_schema.py`) | PASS | `qc_reference_images`, `qc_process_cards`, `qc_comparison_reports` all present |
| PRAGMA integrity_check | PASS | `ok` |
| PRAGMA foreign_key_check | PASS | `[]` (no violations) |

QC ORM models registered in `src/db/models/__init__.py` (PR #12 fix — Bug Fix #2 from Codex P2).

---

## 8. Bugs Found

| ID | Severity | Module | Description | Repro Command | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-001 | Low/Info | `run_bm_e2e_mvp.py` | IEG event logger warns `no such table: execution_events` when DB mode is off (default). Warning is non-fatal — script continues and passes. | `uv run python scripts/run_bm_e2e_mvp.py` (default DB-off mode) | Suppress warning when `GIRAFFE_DB_MODE=off`; or gate event logger on DB mode flag. |

> No functional failures. B-001 is a non-fatal warning that does not affect correctness.

## 9. Final Verdict

**PASS WITH GAPS**

All required internal/mock flows pass across 3 consecutive clean-state runs:
- B-side independent deployment: PASS
- M-side independent deployment: PASS
- B/M E2E: PASS
- AI Merchandiser post-confirmation: PASS
- Logistics: PASS
- QC Qwen default provider + interface: PASS
- QC mock fallback (no key): PASS
- OpenClaw normalized WeChat event routing: PASS
- DB-off mode: PASS
- DB-on mode: PASS

**Gaps (not failures — credentials not present in environment):**
- Real Qwen call: SKIPPED (no `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` / `QWEN_API_KEY`)
- Real OpenClaw WeChat bridge: SKIPPED (no live credentials)
