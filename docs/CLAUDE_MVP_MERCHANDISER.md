# CLAUDE CODE INSTRUCTION — Integrated MVP Addendum
# M-side Send/Receive Role Switching + AI Merchandiser + Cainiao-like Logistics API
# Version: Integrated Addendum v1.0

## 0. Mission

Integrate three missing post-confirmation and M-side execution capabilities into the Giraffe Agent MVP:

1. **M-side Send / Receive Role Switching**
   - M is not only switching business roles; M is also switching communication direction.
   - M receives buyer inquiries, sends upstream inquiries, receives upstream replies, and sends a rollup response back to the buyer.
   - Every message must be routed by project, procurement edge, role context, direction, purpose, thread, and correlation token.

2. **AI Merchandiser Module**
   - Must be deployed on both B-side and M-side.
   - B-side AI Merchandiser supports buyer status tracking, milestone review, exception choices, logistics updates, and sign-off.
   - M-side AI Merchandiser supports supplier execution, production reminders, media upload, upstream / subcontractor follow-up, QC updates, logistics handover, and exception reporting.

3. **Automatic Logistics Data Ingestion**
   - Logistics data should primarily be read through Cainiao-like logistics aggregator APIs.
   - Manual entry and mock provider are fallback modes.
   - Tracking data must update the order execution state and Industrial Execution Graph.

This integrated addendum must work with:

- B-side OpenClaw-compatible AI Buyer skill.
- M-side role-switching procurement agent.
- Upstream / subcontractor inquiry loop.
- Supplier Response Rollup.
- Professional Free CAD-to-CNC matching.
- Dynamic self-learning database layer.
- Industrial Execution Graph v0.1.

## 1. Core Product Principle

Giraffe Agent has two major execution phases:

```text
AI Buyer = pre-confirmation decision support
AI Merchandiser = post-confirmation execution support
```

AI Buyer handles:

```text
buyer input
→ requirement structuring
→ supplier inquiry
→ supplier response
→ delivery feasibility simulation
→ Top 3 delivery paths
```

AI Merchandiser handles:

```text
order confirmation
→ supplier acceptance
→ production milestones
→ upstream follow-up
→ QC / media confirmation
→ exception handling
→ logistics handover
→ logistics tracking
→ delivery
→ buyer sign-off
→ supplier memory update
```

M-side role switching is the bridge between the two phases.

The M-side actor may be:

```text
1. MAIN_M_SIDE / INBOUND
   Receives inquiry from Buyer B.

2. UPSTREAM_B_SIDE / OUTBOUND
   Sends inquiries to fabric / material / subcontractor / QC / logistics providers.

3. UPSTREAM_B_SIDE / INBOUND
   Receives upstream supplier replies.

4. MAIN_M_SIDE / OUTBOUND
   Sends Supplier Response Rollup back to Buyer B.

5. MAIN_M_SIDE / EXECUTION
   Executes confirmed order and coordinates production, QC, logistics and exceptions.
```

The system must never confuse:

- buyer inquiry messages;
- upstream inquiry messages;
- upstream supplier replies;
- internal approval messages;
- buyer-facing rollup messages;
- progress update messages;
- media upload messages;
- logistics handover messages;
- buyer sign-off messages.

# PART C — Cainiao-like Logistics API Ingestion

## 19. Product Principle

The logistics module should be API-ingestion first.

Main production path:

```text
M-side supplier provides carrier + tracking number
→ Giraffe creates LogisticsShipment
→ Giraffe calls Cainiao-like logistics aggregator API
→ API returns tracking events
→ Giraffe normalizes events
→ Giraffe updates order state
→ Giraffe pushes B-side logistics updates
→ Giraffe records events into Industrial Execution Graph
```

Manual entry and mock provider are fallback modes.

Delivered status must not automatically equal buyer acceptance.  
Delivered status triggers buyer sign-off request.

---

3. Tracking event polling.
4. Webhook payload parsing.
5. Carrier code mapping.
6. Status normalization.
7. Retry and timeout.
8. Idempotency handling.

Do not assume exact Cainiao API field names.  
Use adapter mapping config so real API fields can be added later.

Local MVP must use fixture data shaped like Cainiao-like logistics responses.

Add:

```text
LOGISTICS_PROVIDER=mock
LOGISTICS_API_ENABLED=false

CAINIAO_LIKE_ENABLED=false
CAINIAO_LIKE_API_BASE_URL=

in transit → in_transit
customs clearance → customs
out for delivery → out_for_delivery
delivered → delivered
delivery exception → exception
```

---

```text
shipment_id
+ provider_name
+ tracking_number
+ normalized_status
+ event_time
+ location
+ description_hash
```

If duplicate:

- do not create another event;
- write `LOGISTICS_EVENT_DEDUPED`;
- still update shipment `last_synced_at` if relevant.

---

37. The implementation remains compatible with existing database models and does not remove prior MVP functionality.

---

## 43. Important Constraints

Do not:

- hard-code M as only a supplier;
- route messages only by actor_id;
- mix buyer-facing and upstream threads;
- send buyer-facing rollup without M approval;
- treat logistics delivered status as automatic buyer acceptance;
- require real Cainiao API credentials for local MVP;
- bypass webhook signature verification in production mode;
- expose confidential CAD / BOM / order documents to logistics provider;
- implement Enterprise CAP here;
- remove or break B-side AI Buyer, M-side role switching, CAD-to-CNC Professional Free, dynamic schema or database functions.

Only send logistics provider:

```text
carrier
tracking number
logistics-related reference
```

Do not send confidential engineering files to logistics providers.

---

## 44. Strategic Rationale

Giraffe Agent is not complete if it stops at supplier selection or feasibility simulation.

The buyer pays for execution confidence.  
The supplier needs help executing and communicating the order.  
The platform needs real execution data.

Therefore:

```text
AI Buyer = pre-confirmation decision support
AI Merchandiser = post-confirmation execution support
M-side send / receive role switching = recursive supply-chain communication control
Logistics API ingestion = objective execution signal
Industrial Execution Graph = memory of what actually happened
```

Together, these three modules turn Giraffe from an inquiry tool into an order execution agent.
