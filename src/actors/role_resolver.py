"""
Role Resolver — determines the contextual role of an actor in a project.

Core rule: an actor's role is determined by (project, edge, counterparty),
not by the actor's static type.

Same actor can be:
  - MAIN_M_SIDE when responding to the original buyer
  - UPSTREAM_B_SIDE when asking upstream suppliers
  - ORIGINAL_BUYER when initiating a project
